#CopperLamp
Simple app to control my desk lamp with arduino uno and hc-06 bluetooth module.

#Project Assumptions
I didn't have a desk lamp. Ikea is to far from place where I leave so I build my own lamp with copper pipes.
I wake up about 5 a.m and I'm too lazy to get up from bed and turn light on. So I decided to build this simple app to make my life little easier.


#Librarys and packages:
- Butterknife 
- BluetoothSPP


#Arduino Connection:
- I used HC-05 module on draw but it doesn't matter if you use module HC-05 or HC-06. Only difference is that HC-05 can act as a slave and master whereas HC-06 works only as a slave.
